            <p class="about-me-text">Hi!
                My name is Edgar, and I am a student in the UT Coding Bootcamp. Father of a a lovely Daughter who is
                currently going through her terrible two's, she is my motivation to reach higher goals in life. Apart
                from coding being my passion, my current career has been surrounded by the fitness industry. I have been
                changing peoples lifes since I was 18 years of age, with a decade under my belt and new aspirations in
                life I have set out a new goal.
                That goal is Web Development. The curiosity kept growing and growing through out life. I explored
                Youtube videos on python and even dabbled a bit of Javascript. The course mentioned imposter syndrome,
                defenitly dont feel that. I feel right where I need, there is ALWAYS room to grow!
