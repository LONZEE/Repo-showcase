            <p class="about-me-text">Hi!
                My name is Edgar, and I am a student in the UT Coding Bootcamp. Father of a a lovely Daughter who is currently going through her terrible two's, she is my motivation to reach higher goals in life. Apart from coding being my passion, my current career has been surrounded by the fitness industry. I have been changing peoples lifes since I was 18 years of age, with a decade under my belt and new aspirations in life I have set out a new goal. 
                That goal is Web Development. The curiosity kept growing and growing through out life. I explored Youtube videos on python and even dabbled a bit of Javascript. The course mentioned imposter syndrome, defenitly dont feel that. I feel right where I need, there is ALWAYS room to grow!
